Note that changes to the GNU SASL Library is documented in lib/NEWS.
This file track changes to the remaining, non-library, parts of GNU
SASL.  That include the manual, the command line tool, and self tests.

* Version 1.10.0 (released 2021-01-01) [stable]

** This is a new major stable release.  Brief changes compared to 1.8.x:

*** SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS support per RFC 7677.

*** SCRAM supports password-less usage (StoredKey/ServerKey).

*** New 'gsasl --mkpasswd' command to prepare SCRAM salted/hashed passwords.

*** Final warning that obsolete APIs will be removed.

*** Various cleanups, portability and other bug fixes.
See the entries in NEWS and lib/NEWS covering the 1.9.x branch for details.

* Version 1.9.3 (released 2021-01-01) [beta]

** Fix build/portability problems.  GnuTLS >= 3.4 is required.
Thanks to Bruno Haible for reports.

* Version 1.9.2 (released 2020-12-24) [beta]

** gsasl: Don't abort command on some exepected TLS events (for TLS 1.3).
Patch from Enrico Scholz <enrico.scholz@sigma-chemnitz.de> in:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gsasl/2020-08/msg00000.html

** gsasl: Use GnuTLS system trust settings by default for X.509 server
** certificate validation.
Before it was documented behaviour that unless --x509-ca-file was
used, no verification of the server-side certificate was performed.
Now instead it will use the system trust settings, which on properly
configured systems results in verification of the server certificate.
As a result, you may now start to get server certificate verification
errors in situations where you didn't expect them.  Use --x509-ca-file
with the empty string ("") as a file name to use the old behaviour to
not abort on server certificate verification failures.

** SCRAM, GS2 and GSSAPI retrieve properties later in
** the authentication process.
Before the property GSASL_CB_TLS_UNIQUE was retrieved during SCRAM
gsasl_client_start() and gsasl_server_start(), and the properties
GSSAPI_SERVICE and GSSAPI_HOSTNAME was retrived during GS2/GSSAPI
gsasl_server_start().  Now they are retrieved during the first call to
gsasl_step().

The only user-visible impact of this should be that 'gsasl
--client-mechanisms' and 'gsasl --server-mechanisms' will now not
query for parameters before giving a list of supported mechanisms,
which arguable gives a better user experience.  The downside of this
is that SCRAM-*-PLUS, GS2 and GSSAPI may be advertised even though
completing the server mechanism may not complete.

The problem with calling callbacks in the start() function is that the
callback will have no per-session context at that point, only a global
context, so the only way to give per-session unique callback responses
is to use a separate global handle per session.  This was discovered
in the Exim implementation of gsasl with SCRAM that used to request
the GSASL_CB_TLS_UNIQUE property in the start() function.  After
noticing this design issue, and writing this self test, it was
discovered that it also happened for the GSSAPI/GS2 server (not
client) mechanism for the GSASL_SERVICE and GSASL_HOSTNAME properties.

Thanks to Jeremy Harris for noticing the problem and discussion, see
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gsasl/2020-01/msg00035.html

** gsasl: The --mkpasswd output format follows Dovecot 'doveadm pw'.

** Filenames of images in the manual are now prefixed with 'gsasl-'.
This makes /usr/share/info more understandable, and it is suggested by
at least Debian to do this in upstream.

** Build changes.
Some more compiler warnings used and code fixed.  Improved ./configure
diagnostics.

* Version 1.9.1 (released 2020-01-14) [beta]

** gsasl: New --mkpasswd argument to prepare salted/hashed passwords.
Currently mechanisms SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256 are supported.  New
parameter --iteration-count to indicate number of PBKDF2 rounds,
default being 65536.  New parameter --salt to specify PBKDF2 salt.

* Version 1.9.0 (released 2020-01-03) [beta]

** Client and server support for SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS.

** gsasl: If PORT argument is "587" or "submission", SMTP mode is used.
Further, unrecognized PORT arguments will now on raise an error to
specify --smtp or --imap.

* Version 1.8.1 (released 2019-08-02) [stable]

** gsasl: IMAP client code now permits empty SASL tokens prefixed with '+'.
Normally servers should send '+ '.  Buggy servers include Microsoft
Exchange.  Reported by Adam Sj√∏gren.

** GSSAPI client: Now retrieves GSASL_AUTHZID for authorization identity.
** GSSAPI client: Can now transmit an empty/missing authorization identity.
See lib/NEWS for more information.

** Build fixes.
Update of gnulib, including how it is bootstrapped.

** i18n: Updated translations.

* Version 1.8.0 (released 2012-05-28) [stable]

** This is a new major stable release.  Brief changes compared to 1.6.x:

*** SAML20 support following RFC 6595.

*** OPENID20 support following RFC 6616.

*** Added SMTP server examples (for e.g., SCRAM, SAML20, OPENID20).

*** Various cleanups, portability and other bug fixes.
See the NEWS entries during the 1.7.x branch for details.

* Version 1.7.6 (released 2012-05-23) [beta]

** i18n: Updated translations.

** Build fixes.

* Version 1.7.5 (released 2012-05-22) [beta]

** i18n: Updated translations.

** Build fixes.

* Version 1.7.4 (released 2012-05-16) [alpha]

** Doc fixes and updates for the callback/property change in the library.
See lib/NEWS for details.  This affects SAML and OpenID.

** Slight fixes to Windows build script.

* Version 1.7.3 (released 2012-04-03) [alpha]

** The SAML20 mechanism has been updated and is now enabled by default.

** Doc fixes and updates for the callback/property change in the library.
See lib/NEWS for details.

** examples: Added example SMTP server with SAML 2.0 support.
See examples/saml20/README.  It uses Lasso as the SAML implementation.
You may disable Lasso by using --without-lasso.  Note that Lasso is
only needed for this example server, it is not needed by the GNU SASL
library or command line tools itself.

* Version 1.7.2 (released 2012-03-28) [alpha]

** gsasl: The client lets the server decide when authentication is complete.
Before the client quit from the authentication loop when the local
mechanism was finished, but some mechanisms (OPENID20) have optional
additional round-trips.

** gsasl: Added OPENID20 support.

** gsasl: The --no-cb parameter now avoids even attempting to get the
** channel binding data from GnuTLS.
Apparently this can avoid issues when GnuTLS fails to provide the CB.

** examples: Added stand-alone example SMTP server.
See examples/smtp-server.c.  This illustrate how to write a server
using GNU SASL, but it can also be used for interop testing of
clients.

** examples: Added example SMTP server with OpenID 2.0 support.
See examples/openid20/README.

* Version 1.7.1 (released 2012-02-09) [alpha]

** i18n: Updated German translation.

* Version 1.4.0 (released 2009-11-17) [stable]

** No changes since 1.3.91 release candidate.
The release numbering scheme has changed compared to the last stable
release.  In the future we will use version numbers X.Y.Z with even Y
to indicate stable releases and odd Y to indicate experimental
releases.  Z is incremented by one for every release on a particular
branch.  For example, the next stable release will either be 1.4.1 or
1.6.0 and the next experimental release will be 1.5.0.  The intention
is that the stable branches can be used for security bug fixes if/when
there is a need.  Other changes or new features will (typically) not
be back-ported to a stable branch but instead will have to wait for
the next stable branch to be released.

* Version 1.3.91 (released 2009-11-06) [experimental]

** doc: Fix doc/cyclo/ output.

* Version 1.3.90 (released 2009-11-06) [experimental]

** tests/crypto: Also test newly added SHA-1 interfaces.

** tests/scram: Also test GSASL_SCRAM_SALTED_PASSWORD case.
This code path triggered a crash in v1.3.

** i18n: Added Finnish translation.
Thanks to Jorma Karvonen <karvonen.jorma@gmail.com>.

* Version 1.3 (released 2009-10-08)

** Experimental support for SCRAM-SHA-1 added.
Please test it but don't put it into production use, the RFC have not
been finalized yet.  For this reason, the mechanism priority list is
such that SCRAM-SHA-1 will never be selected over any other mechanism
(including PLAIN, CRAM-MD5, and DIGEST-MD5).  When it has been tested
further, we'll make SCRAM-SHA-1 the preferred mechanism after GSSAPI.

** gsasl: Fix libintl-related build errors on MinGW.
Tiny patch from "carlo.bramix" <carlo.bramix@libero.it>.

** doc: Typo fixes to manual.
Based on report by Marco Maggi <marco.maggi-ipsu@poste.it> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.gsasl.general/222>.

** gsasl: Fix out of bounds write when in IMAP/SMTP mode.
Reported by Enrico Scholz <enrico.scholz@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de> in
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.gsasl.general/230>.

** doc: Rewritten introduction material.

** doc: Improved sections for the info manual.
We now follow the advice given by the texinfo manual on which
directory categories to use.  In particular, libgsasl moved from the
'GNU Libraries' section to the 'Software libraries' as GNU SASL, and
'Invoking gsasl' moved from 'GNU utilities' to 'Security'.

** examples: Removed unneeded 'ctx' parameter from client_authenticate.

** Building with many warning flags now requires --enable-gcc-warnings.
This avoids crying wolf for normal compiles.

** New configure parameters to set packaging specific information.
The parameters are --with-packager, --with-packager-version, and
--with-packager-bug-reports.  See
<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.gnulib.bugs/17791> for more
details.

* Version 1.1 (released 2009-03-25)

** gsasl: Reading integrity protected data from server now works.

** Vietnamese translation added, thanks to Clytie Siddall.

* Version 0.2.4 (released 2005-01-01)

** The CRAM-MD5 mechanism is now preferred over DIGEST-MD5.
This decision was based on recent public research that suggest MD5 is
broken, while HMAC-MD5 not immediately compromised, and the lack of
public analysis on what consequences the MD5 break have for
DIGEST-MD5.  Support for CRAM-SHA1 is under investigation, to enable
users to avoid MD5 completely

** Fixed a bug that prevented SMTP client from working.

** New configure option --disable-obsolete to remove backwards compatibility.
This is mostly intended to be used when compiling for platforms with
constrained memory/space resources.

** DIGEST-MD5 rewritten and enabled by default (see lib/NEWS for details).

** Command line tool uses new callback interface to the library.

** Command line tool uses "iconvme" from gnulib for UTF-8 string conversion.

** Server mode in the command line tool does not work currently.
It is unclear if this feature was ever that useful.  If there are no
objections, it will be removed completely in future versions.

** Documentation fixes.

** Fix self test bugs.

** Update of gnulib files.

* Version 0.2.1 (released 2004-11-19)

** Documentation fixes; the old callback API functions are marked as obsolete.

* Version 0.2.0 (released 2004-11-07)

** Added new directory examples/ with complete examples for new API.

** Documentation improvements.
For example, you can now browse the GNU SASL API manual using DevHelp.

** Update of gnulib files.

** More self tests.

** Translation fixes.

* Version 0.1.4 (released 2004-08-08)

** Revamp of gnulib compatibility files.

German (by Roland Illig), Basque (by Mikel Olasagasti), French (by
Michel Robitaille), Irish (by Kevin Patrick Scannell), Dutch (by Elros
Cyriatan), Polish (by Jakub Bogusz), Romanian (by Laurentiu Buzdugan),
and Serbian (by Aleksandar Jelenak).

* Version 0.1.3 (released 2004-08-04)

** Command line tool support IPv6 (and other protocol families).
Requires that your system has `getaddrinfo'.

** Command line behaviour for gsasl tool improved.
The --client and --imap parameters are now the default.  The --connect
host and port can now be specified directly.  If --authentication-id
is not specified, the username of the user invoking gsasl is used
(i.e., getpwuid(getuid)->pw_name).  Alltogether, this allows simple
usage, as in `gsasl mail.example.com' to connect, via IMAP, to
mail.example.com.

* Version 0.1.2 (released 2004-07-16)

** The SMTP mode in `gsasl' should now work.

** Cross compile builds should work.
It should work for any sane cross compile target, but the only tested
platform is uClibc/uClinux on Motorola Coldfire.

** The GNU Readline library is used to read data, if available.

** Passwords read from stdin are not echoed to the terminal.

* Version 0.1.1 (released 2004-06-26)

** In the command line client, the default quality of protection is now none.

* Version 0.1.0 (released 2004-04-16)

** The library re-licensed to LGPL and distributed as a separate package.
This means a fork of this NEWS file, all the entries below relate to
the combined work of earlier versions.  New entries above does not
document user visible changes for the library ("libgsasl"), for that
see NEWS in the lib/ sub-directory, which is also distributed as a
stand-alone package.

* Version 0.0.14 (released 2004-01-22)

** Moved all mechanism specific code into sub-directories of lib/.
Each backend is built into its own library (e.g., libgsasl-plain.so),
to facilitate future possible use of dlopen to dynamically load
backends.

** Moved compatibility files (getopt*) to gl/, and added more (strdup*).

* Version 0.0.13 (released 2004-01-17)

** Nettle (the crypto functionality, crypto/) has been updated.
This fixes two portability issues, the new code should work on
platforms that doesn't have inttypes.h and alloca.

* Version 0.0.12 (released 2004-01-15)

** Protocol line parser in 'gsasl' tool more reliable.
Earlier it assumed two lines were sent in one packet in one place, and
sent as two packets in another place.

** Various bugfixes.

* Version 0.0.11 (released 2004-01-06)

** The client part of CRAM-MD5 now uses SASLprep instead of NFKC.
This aligns with draft-ietf-sasl-crammd5-01.

** The CRAM-MD5 challenge string now conform to the proper syntax.

** The string preparation (SASLprep and trace) functions now work correctly.

** DocBook manuals no longer included.
The reason is that recent DocBook tools from the distribution I use
(Debian) fails with an error.  DocBook manuals may be included in the
future, if I can get the tools to work.

** API and ABI modifications.
GSASL_SASLPREP_ERROR: ADD.

* Version 0.0.10 (released 2003-11-22)

** The CRAM-MD5 server now reject invalid passwords.
The logic flaw was introduced in 0.0.9, after blindly making code
changes to shut up valgrind just before the release.

** Various build improvements.
Pkg-config is no longer needed.  GTK-DOC is only used if present.

* Version 0.0.9 (released 2003-11-21)

** Command line client can talk to SMTP servers with --smtp.

** DocBook manuals in XML, PDF, PostScript, ASCII and HTML formats included.

** Token parser in DIGEST-MD5 fixed, improve interoperability of DIGEST-MD5.

** Libgcrypt >= 1.1.42 is used if available (for CRAM-MD5 and DIGEST-MD5).
The previous libgcrypt API is no longer supported.

** CRAM-MD5 and DIGEST-MD5 no longer require libgcrypt (but can still use it).
If libgcrypt 1.1.42 or later is not found, it uses a minimalistic
cryptographic library based on Nettle, from crypto/.  Currently only
MD5 and HMAC-MD5 is needed, making a dependence on libgcrypt overkill.

** Listing supported server mechanisms with gsasl_server_mechlist work.

** Autoconf 2.59, Automake 1.8 beta, Libtool CVS used.

** Source code for each SASL mechanism moved to its own sub-directory in lib/.

** The command line interface now uses getopt instead of argp.
The reason is portability, this also means we no longer use gnulib.

** API and ABI modifications.

* Version 0.0.8 (released 2003-10-11)

** Improved GSSAPI implementation detection.
Auto detection should work, unless you have both MIT and Heimdal, or
wish to override the default that prefer GSS over Heimdal over MIT.
In that case, use --enable-gssapi=mit or --enable-gssapi=heimdal.

** GNU SASL contain APIs for internationalized string processing via SASLprep.
You no longer have to use Libidn directly.

** Man pages for all public functions are included.

** GNULib is used for compatibility functions.
The directory gl/ is dedicated for GNULib functions, and replace the
earlier ad-hoc usage of argp, memset, etc.

** GNU SASL will be C89 compatible.
The library itself (lib/*) only use C89.  The remaining parts (src/
and tests/) can use C89 and any functionality from GNULib.  This
decision may be revised in the future, if it turns out there are
problems with this.

** Improvements for embedded or otherwise limited systems.
The math library (-lm) is no longer required.  All client code can be
disabled by --disable-client, and all server code can be disabled by
--disable-server.  The internationalized string processing library can
be disabled by --without-stringprep.

** Gettext 0.12.1 and Libtool 1.5 is used.

** Libgcrypt from CVS (1.1.42) is not supported.
Recent libgcrypt is API incompatible with earlier released versions.
If a too recent version is installed, it will not be used.

** Fix command line tool '--connect --imap' on Solaris.

** Bug fixes.

** API and ABI modifications.
Gsasl_client_callback_maxbuf: CHANGED: 'int' was replaced with 'size_t'.
Gsasl_server_callback_maxbuf: CHANGED: 'int' was replaced with 'size_t'.
gsasl_client_mechlist: NEW.
gsasl_server_mechlist: NEW.
gsasl_client_listmech: DEPRECATED: use gsasl_client_mechlist instead.
gsasl_server_listmech: DEPRECATED: use gsasl_server_mechlist instead.
gsasl_stringprep_nfkc: NEW.
gsasl_stringprep_saslprep: NEW.
gsasl_stringprep_trace: NEW.

* Version 0.0.7 (released 2003-06-02)

** Two new GSS libraries supported for the GSS-API mechanism.
See http://josefsson.org/gss/ for GSS, which uses Shishi for Kerberos 5.
See http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal/ for Heimdal (Kerberos 5).

** Bug fixes.

* Version 0.0.6 (released 2003-03-17)

** Gettext not included.
Due to some conflicts between libtool and gettext, if you want i18n on
platforms that does not already have a useful gettext implementation,
you must install GNU gettext before building this package.  If you
don't care about i18n, this package should work fine (except for i18n,
of course).

** Rudimentary support for KERBEROS_V5.
Only enable if you want to write code.  This adds two new API errors;
GSASL_KERBEROS_V5_INIT_ERROR, GSASL_SHISHI_ERROR.

** Added API function: gsasl_client_callback_realm_set.
Specifies which realm the client belongs to.

** Bugfixes.
User visible aspects includes not building the API Reference Manual
with GTK-DOC by default, if you want it use configure parameter
--enable-gtk-doc.

* Version 0.0.5 (released 2003-01-27)

** Command line application "gsasl" now supports --imap and --connect.
The --imap parameter makes it use a IMAP-like negotiation on
stdin/stdout.  The --connect parameter makes it connect to a host over
TCP, and talk to it instead of stdin/stdout.  This allows it to be
used as a simple test tool to connect to IMAP servers.  Currently
integrity and confidentiality is not working properly, so if you use
DIGEST-MD5 you currently have to specify --quality-of-protection=auth.

** Texinfo documentation added for command line tool.

** Libgcrypt initialization no longer causes a warning to be printed.

** Added API reference manual in HTML format, generated using GTK-DOC.
See doc/reference/, in particular doc/reference/html/index.html.

** GNU Libidn replaces Libstringprep.
Although it is still stored in the libstringprep/ directory for CVS
reasons.

** Bug fixes for DIGEST-MD5 and GSSAPI.

* Version 0.0.4 (released 2002-12-13)

** License changed to GPL.

** Official GNU project.

* Version 0.0.3 (released 2002-12-05)

** New gsasl arguments --application-data and --no-client-first.

** Bug fixes (client sends first, memory leaks, compiler warnings, more).

* Version 0.0.2 (released 2002-11-07)

** Includes a copy of libstringprep 0.0.2 for Unicode NFKC
normalization and locale charset to UTF-8 string conversion, and
preparation for the future if a SASL Stringprep profile is created.
If libstringprep is already installed, it is used by default.  You can
force the use of the internal version with
--without-system-libstringprep.

** Uses pkg-config instead of libgsasl.m4 + libgsasl-config.in, and
for finding libntlm (requires libntlm 0.3.1 or later).

** Self tests for several mechanisms.

** The API now allows mechanisms to return data even when returning
GSASL_OK (earlier only on GSASL_NEEDS_MORE).

** Bug fixes.

* Version 0.0.1 (released 2002-10-12)

** APIs for integrity and confidentiality protection of application
payload data.

** DIGEST-MD5 support for integrity protection.

* Version 0.0.0 (released 2002-10-07)

** Initial release.
