version string to compare with, or NULL.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Check GNU SASL Library version.

See \fBGSASL_VERSION\fP for a suitable  \fIreq_version\fP string.

This function is one of few in the library that can be used without
a successful call to \fBgsasl_init()\fP.

Return value: Check that the version of the library is at
minimum the one given as a string in  \fIreq_version\fP and return the
actual version string of the library; return NULL if the
condition is not met.  If NULL is passed to this function no
check is done and only the version string is returned.
