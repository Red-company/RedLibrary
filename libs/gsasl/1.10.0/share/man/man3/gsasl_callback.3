.SH NAME
gsasl_callback \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gsasl.h>
.sp
.BI "int gsasl_callback(Gsasl * " ctx ", Gsasl_session * " sctx ", Gsasl_property " prop ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Gsasl * ctx" 12
handle received from \fBgsasl_init()\fP, may be NULL to derive it
from  \fIsctx\fP .
.IP "Gsasl_session * sctx" 12
session handle.
.IP "Gsasl_property prop" 12
enumerated value of Gsasl_property type.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Invoke the application callback.  The  \fIprop\fP value indicate what the
callback is expected to do.  For example, for
\fBGSASL_ANONYMOUS_TOKEN\fP, the function is expected to invoke
gsasl_property_set( \fISCTX\fP , \fBGSASL_ANONYMOUS_TOKEN\fP, "token") where
"token" is the anonymous token the application wishes the SASL
mechanism to use.  See the manual for the meaning of all
parameters.

Note that if no callback has been set by the application, but the
obsolete callback interface has been used, this function will
translate the old callback interface into the new.  This interface
should be sufficient to invoke all callbacks, both new and old.

Return value: Returns whatever the application callback returns, or
\fBGSASL_NO_CALLBACK\fP if no application was known.
.SH "SINCE"
