.SH NAME
gsasl_callback_set \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gsasl.h>
.sp
.BI "void gsasl_callback_set(Gsasl * " ctx ", Gsasl_callback_function " cb ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "Gsasl * ctx" 12
handle received from \fBgsasl_init()\fP.
.IP "Gsasl_callback_function cb" 12
pointer to function implemented by application.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Store the pointer to the application provided callback in the
library handle.  The callback will be used, via \fBgsasl_callback()\fP,
by mechanisms to discover various parameters (such as username and
passwords).  The callback function will be called with a
Gsasl_property value indicating the requested behaviour.  For
example, for \fBGSASL_ANONYMOUS_TOKEN\fP, the function is expected to
invoke gsasl_property_set( \fICTX\fP , \fBGSASL_ANONYMOUS_TOKEN\fP, "token")
where "token" is the anonymous token the application wishes the
SASL mechanism to use.  See the manual for the meaning of all
parameters.
